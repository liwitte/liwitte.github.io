## About Me

I am Lily Witte, a second-year undergraduate student at Indiana University - Bloomington in computer science and I plan to graduate in Spring of 2027.  I am a student-athlete at IU; I am on the Women's Swimming and Diving Team. I traveled and competed in the Olympic trials this summer for diving in Knoxville, TN. I am traveling to Florida with my family for vacation this summer before school starts up again.

## About My Project

Our research project will investigate the needs of people who experience Pelvic Organ Prolapse (POP) by qualitatively analyzing the posts they create on Reddit. POP affects countless women after giving birth, impacting their daily lives, and yet most women are not aware of POP and do not get the assistance they need. Our research will dive into three main aspects: informational needs, sources of information, and rehabilitation experiences. Our approach involves Reddit scraping techniques, ethical data collection, and qualitative and quantitative analyses.  Our research aims to enhance care and support for POP patients.  
- week of 6/3: Completed the CITI and RCR exams, created an elevator pitch about our research project, created a qualitative research checklist based on the work of Virginia Braun and Victoria Clarke, started reading, analyzing, and writing summaries on POP background pubs and CHI Reproductive Health pubs, overviewed the current scrape from Colin LeFevre
- week of 6/10: Completed the initial outline for the POP background, related works, and methods, continued adding citations, and reading research papers related to our study, read through the top 25 most commented-on Reddit posts in each subreddit (r/PelvicOrganProlapse, r/PelvicFloor, and r/beyondthebump)
- week of 6/17: Completed the introduction outline, completed the full draft of our methods, started the work and partially completed the related works draft, continued to read through the top 25 most commented-on Reddit posts, looking for themes and taking notes.
- week of 6/24: Completed the first draft of the introduction, continued editing the methods draft based on peer reviews, finished reading through the top 25 most commented-on Reddit posts and used notes to brainstorm ideas on qualitative coding, helped create the first, rough pass at the codebook with codes and definitions, set up and learned about LaTex (the website/framework we are using to write our paper)
